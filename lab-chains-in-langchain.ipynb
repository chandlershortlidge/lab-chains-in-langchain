      "content='A queen size sheet set typically includes several pieces designed to fit a standard queen size bed, which measures approximately 60 inches wide by 80 inches long. The set usually consists of the following components:\\n\\n1. **Fitted Sheet**: This sheet has elastic corners to ensure a snug fit around the mattress. It is designed to accommodate mattresses of varying depths, often ranging from 8 to 18 inches, depending on the specific product.\\n\\n2. **Flat Sheet**: Also known as a top sheet, this piece lies between the sleeper and the comforter or blanket. It provides an additional layer of warmth and is often used to protect the blanket from getting dirty.\\n\\n3. **Pillowcases**: A queen size sheet set typically includes two pillowcases. They are designed to fit standard or queen size pillows, which measure approximately 20 inches by 30 inches.\\n\\nThe material of a queen size sheet set can vary widely, with common options including cotton, microfiber, bamboo, linen, and polyester. Each material has its own characteristics in terms of softness, breathability, durability, and ease of care. Cotton, for example, is known for its softness and breathability, while microfiber is appreciated for its affordability and wrinkle resistance.\\n\\nThread count is another important factor, especially for cotton sheets, as it indicates the number of threads per square inch of fabric. Generally, a higher thread count can mean a softer and more durable sheet, but this is not always the case, as the quality of the threads also plays a significant role.\\n\\nQueen size sheet sets come in a wide range of colors, patterns, and designs to match different bedroom decor styles. They may also feature special finishes, such as wrinkle-resistant or cooling technologies, to enhance their functionality and comfort.' additional_kwargs={'refusal': None} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 353, 'prompt_tokens': 15, 'total_tokens': 368, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-2024-08-06', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_ad98c18a04', 'id': 'chatcmpl-D7I33gI54dJPKmbE19z04YSJxRfPg', 'service_tier': 'default', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='run--019c41c6-5d8c-7500-acac-b15cb47cb3ea-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 15, 'output_tokens': 353, 'total_tokens': 368, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}\n"
